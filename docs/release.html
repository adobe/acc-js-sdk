<p>In a nutshell</p>

<pre class="code">
npm i
npm run unit-tests
npm audit
node_modules/jshint/bin/jshint src/
npm run jsdoc
open ./docs/jsdoc/index.html
node ./compile.js
</pre>


<p>To release and deploy to npm</p>

<p>Push a commit with message <b>Release 1.2.3</b> in master<p>
  
<pre class="code">
git commit -m "Release 1.2.3"
git push origin
</pre>

<p class="info">There's a publication action that will publish released automatically when there's a commit named "Release ..." in master AND the version matches the one in package.json
Do not create a git tag for this version, the publication hook will take care of it. If you have created a tag with the release name, the publication will fail
</p> 

<p>You can follow the results of the actions <a href="https://github.com/adobe/acc-js-sdk/actions">here</a></p>

<p class="info">It usually takes a few hours for the package to show up in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/acc-js-sdk">NPM UI</a> but you can still use the package by using npm</p>
